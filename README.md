### Project Description:

1. Started by analyzing the data and understanding the features.
** Categorical features were already encoded into new categorical columns with a binary value assigned.
2. Created dataframes and series for features and target respectively.
3. Noticed that there was a class imbalance but decided to proceed with baseline value without managing imbalance.
4. After splitting the train/test set, ran a RandomForestClassifier to get a baseline score.
